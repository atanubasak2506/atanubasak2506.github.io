1. [Employee Attrition Project](https://github.com/atanubasak2506/Data_Mining/tree/main/Employee%20Attrition%20Analysis): Attrition is a big problem of all the organization, sometime
people leave their current job, when they are Not satisfied with their work, salary,
promotion or could be due to another reason. The Human Resource Team collects
different data from employees to identify the reasons for attrition. This data is created by
IBM data scientist, and it has several attributes that can help to identify the reasons for
attrition. Some of the important fields are Business Travel, Department, Distance from
Home, Employment satisfaction, Hourly Rate, Job Involvement, Monthly Income,
Overtime, Performance Rating, Salary hike, Years Since Last promotion etc.
I did some exploratory data analysis to do the analysis on the attributes and tried to find
the relationship between attributes and attrition field. I fit a few models, that can predict an
employee if he/she will be having attrition.



3. Fitting Regression Model to fit miles per gallon of cars: In this project, I tried to fit a
regression model to predict the miles per gallon of different car. For this project, I have
chosen the from Kaggle website, I did some analysis using scatter plots, then fit Linear
Regression, Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression and compared the accuracy of them.
4. Loan Status Prediction: In this project, I am using logistic regression and random forest
classifier to predict the chances of a loan getting paid. I have chosen Kaggle as the data
source and after fitting the model, I have calculated the accuracy of both the model for
model selection.
5. Data Analysis on Fifa 2022: In this project, I have collected the data for 2022 FIFA
soccer. I did different analysis at group and county level games, that occured on Fifa 2022.
6. Crime Rate Analysis: In this project, I did analysis on crime rate and tried to present the
analysis by different plots. This is small data with crime rates by different year, with the
plots, I presented how crimes decreased over the time.
7. Visual Analysis project on various data: In this project I did analysis on 3 different
data, one was world population data, then unemployment data and lastly expenditure
data. I tried to present different plots with python libraries and explain the graphs
accordingly.
8. Data Wrangling project on world population data: In this project, I have done the data
preparation using the world population data from Kaggle. In this project I have written
several python functions and tried to create new attributes based on other attributes, so
that those. attributes can be used for further data analysis and presentation.
9. Data Wrangling project on Boston housing data and Income: In this project I have
read the data for Boston Housing, that I got from Kaggle, I did further research on several
attributes along in proper plotting. I also did data analysis on income data, I did further
analysis on other factors to identify, what are the factors that influence income.
10. Project on EV Cars: In this project, I tried to understand the analysis on EV Cars, what
are the major electric ranges and major brands on the ev market.
11. SQlite Project: In this project, I tried to connect with petDB from python and able to
run several queries from python, using SQLite.
